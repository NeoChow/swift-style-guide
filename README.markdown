# raywenderlich.com 官方 Swift 风格指南
### 更新至 Swift 4.2

This style guide is different from others you may see, because the focus is centered on readability for print and the web. We created this style guide to keep the code in our books, tutorials, and starter kits nice and consistent — even though we have many different authors working on the books.

Our overarching goals are clarity, consistency and brevity, in that order.

## 正确性

尽量让代码以无警告编译通过。这条规则阐明了许多风格决定，例如，使用`#selector`类型，而不是字符串字面值。

## 命名

描述性和一贯性命名让软件更易读和理解。使用[API设计指南](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)中描述的 Swift 命名惯例。一些关键摘要包括：

- 努力保持使用处的清晰度
- 清晰度比简洁度更优先
- 使用驼峰表示法（而不是蛇行表示法）（译者注：使用 camelCase, 而不是 snake_case）
- 类型（和协议）用大写，其他情况用小写 （译者注：这里说的是英文首字母）
- 略去不必要单词的同时包括进所有需要的那些
- 根据角色使用名字，而不是类型
- 有时需要补全弱类型信息
- 努力达到流畅使用
- 工厂方法以`make`开头
- 根据副作用给方法命名
  - 动词型方法的不可修改版本遵循-ed、 -ing时态规则
  - 名词型方法的可修改版本遵循 formX 规则
  - Bool类型读起来应该像断言
  - 描述 _是什么东西_ 的协议读起来应该像名词
  - 描述 _某项能力_ 的协议应该以 _-able_ 或 _-ible_ 结尾
- 用到的词语应该既不让专家感到惊奇，也不让初学者感到困惑
- 一般情况下避免使用简称
- 使用上文提到过的名字
- 倾向于使用方法和属性，而不是全局函数
- 首字母缩写词统一使用大写或小写
- 具有相同含义的方法应该具有相同的基本名
- 避免对返回类型进行重载
- 选择可以作为文档的参数名
- 除了委托那一节提到的，应该给方法的第一个参数命名，而不是把它写到方法名字里面
- 给闭包和元组类型的参数添加标签
- （可以的话）使用默认参数

### 正文

当在正文中引用方法时，准确无误非常关键。引用方法名时，使用尽可能简单的形式。

1. Write the method name with no parameters.  **Example:** Next, you need to call `addTarget`.
2. Write the method name with argument labels.  **Example:** Next, you need to call `addTarget(_:action:)`.
3. Write the full method name with argument labels and types. **Example:** Next, you need to call `addTarget(_: Any?, action: Selector?)`.

For the above example using `UIGestureRecognizer`, 1 is unambiguous and preferred.

**Pro Tip:** You can use Xcode's jump bar to lookup methods with argument labels. If you’re particularly good at mashing lots of keys simultaneously, put the cursor in the method name and press **Shift-Control-Option-Command-C** (all 4 modifier keys) and Xcode will kindly put the signature on your clipboard.

![Methods in Xcode jump bar](screens/xcode-jump-bar.png)


### 类的前缀

Swift types are automatically namespaced by the module that contains them and you should not add a class prefix such as RW. If two names from different modules collide you can disambiguate by prefixing the type name with the module name. However, only specify the module name when there is possibility for confusion which should be rare.

```swift
import SomeModule

let myClass = MyModule.UsefulClass()
```

### 委托

当创建自定义的委托方法时，它的第一个参数应该是委托源，且该参数名字可在调用时省略。（UIKit库里面包含许多这样的例子）

**倾向于**:
```swift
func namePickerView(_ namePickerView: NamePickerView, didSelectName name: String)
func namePickerViewShouldReload(_ namePickerView: NamePickerView) -> Bool
```

**而不是**:
```swift
func didSelectName(namePicker: NamePickerViewController, name: String)
func namePickerShouldReload() -> Bool
```

### 使用编译器可推理的上下文

使用编译器可推理的上下文来写简短、清晰的代码。（同时查阅 [类型推理](#类型推理).）

**倾向于**:
```swift
let selector = #selector(viewDidLoad)
view.backgroundColor = .red
let toView = context.view(forKey: .to)
let view = UIView(frame: .zero)
```

**而不是**:
```swift
let selector = #selector(ViewController.viewDidLoad)
view.backgroundColor = UIColor.red
let toView = context.view(forKey: UITransitionContextViewKey.to)
let view = UIView(frame: CGRect.zero)
```

### 泛型

泛型参数应该是描述性的、首字母大写的驼峰命名法名字。若没有一个有意义的关系或角色，使用传统式的单个大写字母，如：`T`, `U`, 或 `V`。

**倾向于**:
```swift
struct Stack<Element> { ... }
func write<Target: OutputStream>(to target: inout Target)
func swap<T>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T)
```

**而不是**:
```swift
struct Stack<T> { ... }
func write<target: OutputStream>(to target: inout target)
func swap<Thing>(_ a: inout Thing, _ b: inout Thing)
```

### 语言

使用美式英语拼写规则来匹配苹果公司的 API。

**倾向于**:
```swift
let color = "red"
```

**而不是**:
```swift
let colour = "red"
```

## 代码组织

用扩展把代码组织成具有逻辑性的功能模块。各个扩展之间应该以 `// MARK: -` 注释来隔开。

### 协议的遵循

In particular, when adding protocol conformance to a model, prefer adding a separate extension for the protocol methods. This keeps the related methods grouped together with the protocol and can simplify instructions to add a protocol to a class with its associated methods.

**倾向于**:
```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController {
  // class stuff here
}

// MARK: - UITableViewDataSource
extension MyViewController: UITableViewDataSource {
  // table view data source methods
}

// MARK: - UIScrollViewDelegate
extension MyViewController: UIScrollViewDelegate {
  // scroll view delegate methods
}
```

**而不是**:
```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UIScrollViewDelegate {
  // all methods
}
```

Since the compiler does not allow you to re-declare protocol conformance in a derived class, it is not always required to replicate the extension groups of the base class. This is especially true if the derived class is a terminal class and a small number of methods are being overridden. When to preserve the extension groups is left to the discretion of the author.

For UIKit view controllers, consider grouping lifecycle, custom accessors, and IBAction in separate class extensions.

### 未使用的代码

Unused (dead) code, including Xcode template code and placeholder comments should be removed. An exception is when your tutorial or book instructs the user to use the commented code.

Aspirational methods not directly associated with the tutorial whose implementation simply calls the superclass should also be removed. This includes any empty/unused UIApplicationDelegate methods.

**倾向于**:
```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
  return Database.contacts.count
}
```

**而不是**:
```swift
override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
  super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
  // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
}

override func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
  // #warning Incomplete implementation, return the number of sections
  return 1
}

override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
  // #warning Incomplete implementation, return the number of rows
  return Database.contacts.count
}

```
### 最小化Import

只引入当前源文件需要的模块。例如，当 `Foundation` 满足时，不要引入 `UIKit`。同样地，必须引入 `UIKit` 时，别引入 `Foundation`。

**Preferred**:
```
import UIKit
var view: UIView
var deviceModels: [String]
```

**Preferred**:
```
import Foundation
var deviceModels: [String]
```

**Not Preferred**:
```
import UIKit
import Foundation
var view: UIView
var deviceModels: [String]
```

**Not Preferred**:
```
import UIKit
var deviceModels: [String]
```

## 空格

* Indent using 2 spaces rather than tabs to conserve space and help prevent line wrapping. Be sure to set this preference in Xcode and in the Project settings as shown below:

![Xcode indent settings](screens/indentation.png)

* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.
* Tip: You can re-indent by selecting some code (or **Command-A** to select all) and then **Control-I** (or **Editor ▸ Structure ▸ Re-Indent** in the menu). Some of the Xcode template code will have 4-space tabs hard coded, so this is a good way to fix that.

**Preferred**:
```swift
if user.isHappy {
  // Do something
} else {
  // Do something else
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
if user.isHappy
{
  // Do something
}
else {
  // Do something else
}
```

* There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but having too many sections in a method often means you should refactor into several methods.

* There should be no blank lines after an opening brace or before a closing brace.

* Colons always have no space on the left and one space on the right. Exceptions are the ternary operator `? :`, empty dictionary `[:]` and `#selector` syntax `addTarget(_:action:)`.

**Preferred**:
```swift
class TestDatabase: Database {
  var data: [String: CGFloat] = ["A": 1.2, "B": 3.2]
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
class TestDatabase : Database {
  var data :[String:CGFloat] = ["A" : 1.2, "B":3.2]
}
```

* Long lines should be wrapped at around 70 characters. A hard limit is intentionally not specified.

* Avoid trailing whitespaces at the ends of lines.

* Add a single newline character at the end of each file.

## 注释

When they are needed, use comments to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Comments must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Avoid block comments inline with code, as the code should be as self-documenting as possible. _Exception: This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation._

Avoid the use of C-style comments (`/* ... */`). Prefer the use of double- or triple-slash.

## 类和结构体

### 该使用哪个？

Remember, structs have [value semantics](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-XID_144). Use structs for things that do not have an identity. An array that contains [a, b, c] is really the same as another array that contains [a, b, c] and they are completely interchangeable. It doesn't matter whether you use the first array or the second, because they represent the exact same thing. That's why arrays are structs.

Classes have [reference semantics](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-XID_145). Use classes for things that do have an identity or a specific life cycle. You would model a person as a class because two person objects are two different things. Just because two people have the same name and birthdate, doesn't mean they are the same person. But the person's birthdate would be a struct because a date of 3 March 1950 is the same as any other date object for 3 March 1950. The date itself doesn't have an identity.

Sometimes, things should be structs but need to conform to `AnyObject` or are historically modeled as classes already (`NSDate`, `NSSet`). Try to follow these guidelines as closely as possible.

### 定义案例

Here's an example of a well-styled class definition:

```swift
class Circle: Shape {
  var x: Int, y: Int
  var radius: Double
  var diameter: Double {
    get {
      return radius * 2
    }
    set {
      radius = newValue / 2
    }
  }

  init(x: Int, y: Int, radius: Double) {
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    self.radius = radius
  }

  convenience init(x: Int, y: Int, diameter: Double) {
    self.init(x: x, y: y, radius: diameter / 2)
  }

  override func area() -> Double {
    return Double.pi * radius * radius
  }
}

extension Circle: CustomStringConvertible {
  var description: String {
    return "center = \(centerString) area = \(area())"
  }
  private var centerString: String {
    return "(\(x),\(y))"
  }
}
```

The example above demonstrates the following style guidelines:

 + Specify types for properties, variables, constants, argument declarations and other statements with a space after the colon but not before, e.g. `x: Int`, and `Circle: Shape`.
 + Define multiple variables and structures on a single line if they share a common purpose / context.
 + Indent getter and setter definitions and property observers.
 + Don't add modifiers such as `internal` when they're already the default. Similarly, don't repeat the access modifier when overriding a method.
 + Organize extra functionality (e.g. printing) in extensions.
 + Hide non-shared, implementation details such as `centerString` inside the extension using `private` access control.

### Self的使用

For conciseness, avoid using `self` since Swift does not require it to access an object's properties or invoke its methods.

Use self only when required by the compiler (in `@escaping` closures, or in initializers to disambiguate properties from arguments). In other words, if it compiles without `self` then omit it.


### 计算型属性

For conciseness, if a computed property is read-only, omit the get clause. The get clause is required only when a set clause is provided.

**Preferred**:
```swift
var diameter: Double {
  return radius * 2
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var diameter: Double {
  get {
    return radius * 2
  }
}
```

### 关键字final

Marking classes or members as `final` in tutorials can distract from the main topic and is not required. Nevertheless, use of `final` can sometimes clarify your intent and is worth the cost. In the below example, `Box` has a particular purpose and customization in a derived class is not intended. Marking it `final` makes that clear.

```swift
// Turn any generic type into a reference type using this Box class.
final class Box<T> {
  let value: T
  init(_ value: T) {
    self.value = value
  }
}
```

## 函数声明

Keep short function declarations on one line including the opening brace:

```swift
func reticulateSplines(spline: [Double]) -> Bool {
  // reticulate code goes here
}
```

For functions with long signatures, put each parameter on a new line and add an extra indent on subsequent lines:

```swift
func reticulateSplines(
  spline: [Double], 
  adjustmentFactor: Double,
  translateConstant: Int, comment: String
) -> Bool {
  // reticulate code goes here
}
```

Don't use `(Void)` to represent the lack of an input; simply use `()`. Use `Void` instead of `()` for closure and function outputs.

**Preferred**:

```swift
func updateConstraints() -> Void {
  // magic happens here
}

typealias CompletionHandler = (result) -> Void
```

**Not Preferred**:

```swift
func updateConstraints() -> () {
  // magic happens here
}

typealias CompletionHandler = (result) -> ()
```

## 函数调用

Mirror the style of function declarations at call sites. Calls that fit on a single line should be written as such:

```swift
let success = reticulateSplines(splines)
```

If the call site must be wrapped, put each parameter on a new line, indented one additional level:

```swift
let success = reticulateSplines(
  spline: splines,
  adjustmentFactor: 1.3,
  translateConstant: 2,
  comment: "normalize the display")
```

## 闭包表达式

Use trailing closure syntax only if there's a single closure expression parameter at the end of the argument list. Give the closure parameters descriptive names.

**Preferred**:
```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0) {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
}

UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
}, completion: { finished in
  self.myView.removeFromSuperview()
})
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
})

UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
}) { f in
  self.myView.removeFromSuperview()
}
```

For single-expression closures where the context is clear, use implicit returns:

```swift
attendeeList.sort { a, b in
  a > b
}
```

Chained methods using trailing closures should be clear and easy to read in context. Decisions on spacing, line breaks, and when to use named versus anonymous arguments is left to the discretion of the author. Examples:

```swift
let value = numbers.map { $0 * 2 }.filter { $0 % 3 == 0 }.index(of: 90)

let value = numbers
  .map {$0 * 2}
  .filter {$0 > 50}
  .map {$0 + 10}
```

## 类型

Always use Swift's native types and expressions when available. Swift offers bridging to Objective-C so you can still use the full set of methods as needed.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let width = 120.0                                    // Double
let widthString = "\(width)"                         // String
```

**Less Preferred**:
```swift
let width = 120.0                                    // Double
let widthString = (width as NSNumber).stringValue    // String
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let width: NSNumber = 120.0                          // NSNumber
let widthString: NSString = width.stringValue        // NSString
```

In drawing code, use `CGFloat` if it makes the code more succinct by avoiding too many conversions.

### 常量

Constants are defined using the `let` keyword and variables with the `var` keyword. Always use `let` instead of `var` if the value of the variable will not change.

**Tip:** A good technique is to define everything using `let` and only change it to `var` if the compiler complains!

You can define constants on a type rather than on an instance of that type using type properties. To declare a type property as a constant simply use `static let`. Type properties declared in this way are generally preferred over global constants because they are easier to distinguish from instance properties. Example:

**Preferred**:
```swift
enum Math {
  static let e = 2.718281828459045235360287
  static let root2 = 1.41421356237309504880168872
}

let hypotenuse = side * Math.root2

```
**Note:** The advantage of using a case-less enumeration is that it can't accidentally be instantiated and works as a pure namespace.

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let e = 2.718281828459045235360287  // pollutes global namespace
let root2 = 1.41421356237309504880168872

let hypotenuse = side * root2 // what is root2?
```

### 静态方法和可变类型属性

静态方法和类型属性工作方式类似于全局函数和全局变量，且应该谨慎地使用。当某个功能和一个特定类型相关联，或需要与 Objective-C 交互时，可能会用到它们。

### 可选型

Declare variables and function return types as optional with `?` where a `nil` value is acceptable.

Use implicitly unwrapped types declared with `!` only for instance variables that you know will be initialized later before use, such as subviews that will be set up in `viewDidLoad()`. Prefer optional binding to implicitly unwrapped optionals in most other cases.

When accessing an optional value, use optional chaining if the value is only accessed once or if there are many optionals in the chain:

```swift
textContainer?.textLabel?.setNeedsDisplay()
```

Use optional binding when it's more convenient to unwrap once and perform multiple operations:

```swift
if let textContainer = textContainer {
  // do many things with textContainer
}
```

When naming optional variables and properties, avoid naming them like `optionalString` or `maybeView` since their optional-ness is already in the type declaration.

For optional binding, shadow the original name whenever possible rather than using names like `unwrappedView` or `actualLabel`.

**Preferred**:
```swift
var subview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

// later on...
if let subview = subview, let volume = volume {
  // do something with unwrapped subview and volume
}

// another example
UIView.animate(withDuration: 2.0) { [weak self] in
  guard let self = self else { return }
  self.alpha = 1.0
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var optionalSubview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

if let unwrappedSubview = optionalSubview {
  if let realVolume = volume {
    // do something with unwrappedSubview and realVolume
  }
}

// another example
UIView.animate(withDuration: 2.0) { [weak self] in
  guard let strongSelf = self else { return }
  strongSelf.alpha = 1.0
}
```

### 懒初始化

Consider using lazy initialization for finer grained control over object lifetime. This is especially true for `UIViewController` that loads views lazily. You can either use a closure that is immediately called `{ }()` or call a private factory method. Example:

```swift
lazy var locationManager = makeLocationManager()

private func makeLocationManager() -> CLLocationManager {
  let manager = CLLocationManager()
  manager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest
  manager.delegate = self
  manager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
  return manager
}
```

**Notes:**
  - `[unowned self]` is not required here. A retain cycle is not created.
  - Location manager has a side-effect for popping up UI to ask the user for permission so fine grain control makes sense here.


### 类型推理

Prefer compact code and let the compiler infer the type for constants or variables of single instances. Type inference is also appropriate for small, non-empty arrays and dictionaries. When required, specify the specific type such as `CGFloat` or `Int16`.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let message = "Click the button"
let currentBounds = computeViewBounds()
var names = ["Mic", "Sam", "Christine"]
let maximumWidth: CGFloat = 106.5
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let message: String = "Click the button"
let currentBounds: CGRect = computeViewBounds()
var names = [String]()
```

#### 空数组和字典的类型注解

For empty arrays and dictionaries, use type annotation. (For an array or dictionary assigned to a large, multi-line literal, use type annotation.)

**Preferred**:
```swift
var names: [String] = []
var lookup: [String: Int] = [:]
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var names = [String]()
var lookup = [String: Int]()
```

**NOTE**: Following this guideline means picking descriptive names is even more important than before.


### 语法糖

Prefer the shortcut versions of type declarations over the full generics syntax.

**Preferred**:
```swift
var deviceModels: [String]
var employees: [Int: String]
var faxNumber: Int?
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var deviceModels: Array<String>
var employees: Dictionary<Int, String>
var faxNumber: Optional<Int>
```

## 函数vs方法

Free functions, which aren't attached to a class or type, should be used sparingly. When possible, prefer to use a method instead of a free function. This aids in readability and discoverability.

Free functions are most appropriate when they aren't associated with any particular type or instance.

**Preferred**
```swift
let sorted = items.mergeSorted()  // easily discoverable
rocket.launch()  // acts on the model
```

**Not Preferred**
```swift
let sorted = mergeSort(items)  // hard to discover
launch(&rocket)
```

**Free Function Exceptions**
```swift
let tuples = zip(a, b)  // feels natural as a free function (symmetry)
let value = max(x, y, z)  // another free function that feels natural
```

## 内存管理

Code (even non-production, tutorial demo code) should not create reference cycles. Analyze your object graph and prevent strong cycles with `weak` and `unowned` references. Alternatively, use value types (`struct`, `enum`) to prevent cycles altogether.

### 扩展对象生命周期

Extend object lifetime using the `[weak self]` and `guard let self = self else { return }` idiom. `[weak self]` is preferred to `[unowned self]` where it is not immediately obvious that `self` outlives the closure. Explicitly extending lifetime is preferred to optional chaining.

**Preferred**
```swift
resource.request().onComplete { [weak self] response in
  guard let self = self else {
    return
  }
  let model = self.updateModel(response)
  self.updateUI(model)
}
```

**Not Preferred**
```swift
// might crash if self is released before response returns
resource.request().onComplete { [unowned self] response in
  let model = self.updateModel(response)
  self.updateUI(model)
}
```

**Not Preferred**
```swift
// deallocate could happen between updating the model and updating UI
resource.request().onComplete { [weak self] response in
  let model = self?.updateModel(response)
  self?.updateUI(model)
}
```

## 访问控制

Full access control annotation in tutorials can distract from the main topic and is not required. Using `private` and `fileprivate` appropriately, however, adds clarity and promotes encapsulation. Prefer `private` to `fileprivate`; use `fileprivate` only when the compiler insists.

Only explicitly use `open`, `public`, and `internal` when you require a full access control specification.

Use access control as the leading property specifier. The only things that should come before access control are the `static` specifier or attributes such as `@IBAction`, `@IBOutlet` and `@discardableResult`.

**Preferred**:
```swift
private let message = "Great Scott!"

class TimeMachine {  
  private dynamic lazy var fluxCapacitor = FluxCapacitor()
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
fileprivate let message = "Great Scott!"

class TimeMachine {  
  lazy dynamic private var fluxCapacitor = FluxCapacitor()
}
```

## 控制流

Prefer the `for-in` style of `for` loop over the `while-condition-increment` style.

**Preferred**:
```swift
for _ in 0..<3 {
  print("Hello three times")
}

for (index, person) in attendeeList.enumerated() {
  print("\(person) is at position #\(index)")
}

for index in stride(from: 0, to: items.count, by: 2) {
  print(index)
}

for index in (0...3).reversed() {
  print(index)
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var i = 0
while i < 3 {
  print("Hello three times")
  i += 1
}


var i = 0
while i < attendeeList.count {
  let person = attendeeList[i]
  print("\(person) is at position #\(i)")
  i += 1
}
```

### 三目运算符

The Ternary operator, `?:` , should only be used when it increases clarity or code neatness. A single condition is usually all that should be evaluated. Evaluating multiple conditions is usually more understandable as an `if` statement or refactored into instance variables. In general, the best use of the ternary operator is during assignment of a variable and deciding which value to use.

**Preferred**:

```swift
let value = 5
result = value != 0 ? x : y

let isHorizontal = true
result = isHorizontal ? x : y
```

**Not Preferred**:

```swift
result = a > b ? x = c > d ? c : d : y
```

## 黄金路径

When coding with conditionals, the left-hand margin of the code should be the "golden" or "happy" path. That is, don't nest `if` statements. Multiple return statements are OK. The `guard` statement is built for this.

**Preferred**:
```swift
func computeFFT(context: Context?, inputData: InputData?) throws -> Frequencies {

  guard let context = context else {
    throw FFTError.noContext
  }
  guard let inputData = inputData else {
    throw FFTError.noInputData
  }

  // use context and input to compute the frequencies
  return frequencies
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
func computeFFT(context: Context?, inputData: InputData?) throws -> Frequencies {

  if let context = context {
    if let inputData = inputData {
      // use context and input to compute the frequencies

      return frequencies
    } else {
      throw FFTError.noInputData
    }
  } else {
    throw FFTError.noContext
  }
}
```

When multiple optionals are unwrapped either with `guard` or `if let`, minimize nesting by using the compound version when possible. In the compound version, place the `guard` on its own line, then indent each condition on its own line. The `else` clause is indented to match the conditions and the code is indented one additional level, as shown below. Example:

**Preferred**:
```swift
guard 
  let number1 = number1,
  let number2 = number2,
  let number3 = number3 
  else {
    fatalError("impossible")
}
// do something with numbers
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
if let number1 = number1 {
  if let number2 = number2 {
    if let number3 = number3 {
      // do something with numbers
    } else {
      fatalError("impossible")
    }
  } else {
    fatalError("impossible")
  }
} else {
  fatalError("impossible")
}
```

### Failing Guards

Guard statements are required to exit in some way. Generally, this should be simple one line statement such as `return`, `throw`, `break`, `continue`, and `fatalError()`. Large code blocks should be avoided. If cleanup code is required for multiple exit points, consider using a `defer` block to avoid cleanup code duplication.

## 分号

Swift does not require a semicolon after each statement in your code. They are only required if you wish to combine multiple statements on a single line.

Do not write multiple statements on a single line separated with semicolons.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let swift = "not a scripting language"
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let swift = "not a scripting language";
```

**NOTE**: Swift is very different from JavaScript, where omitting semicolons is [generally considered unsafe](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/444080/do-you-recommend-using-semicolons-after-every-statement-in-javascript)

## 小括号

Parentheses around conditionals are not required and should be omitted.

**Preferred**:
```swift
if name == "Hello" {
  print("World")
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
if (name == "Hello") {
  print("World")
}
```

In larger expressions, optional parentheses can sometimes make code read more clearly.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let playerMark = (player == current ? "X" : "O")
```

## 多行字符串字面值

When building a long string literal, you're encouraged to use the multi-line string literal syntax. Open the literal on the same line as the assignment but do not include text on that line. Indent the text block one additional level.

**Preferred**:

```swift
let message = """
  You cannot charge the flux \
  capacitor with a 9V battery.
  You must use a super-charger \
  which costs 10 credits. You currently \
  have \(credits) credits available.
  """
```

**Not Preferred**:

```swift
let message = """You cannot charge the flux \
  capacitor with a 9V battery.
  You must use a super-charger \
  which costs 10 credits. You currently \
  have \(credits) credits available.
  """
```

**Not Preferred**:

```swift
let message = "You cannot charge the flux " +
  "capacitor with a 9V battery.\n" +
  "You must use a super-charger " +
  "which costs 10 credits. You currently " +
  "have \(credits) credits available."
```

## 禁用表情符

Do not use emoji in your projects. For those readers who actually type in their code, it's an unnecessary source of friction. While it may be cute, it doesn't add to the learning and it interrupts the coding flow for these readers.

## 组织和包标识符

Where an Xcode project is involved, the organization should be set to `Ray Wenderlich` and the Bundle Identifier set to `com.raywenderlich.TutorialName` where `TutorialName` is the name of the tutorial project.

## 笑脸

Smiley faces are a very prominent style feature of the [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/) site! It is very important to have the correct smile signifying the immense amount of happiness and excitement for the coding topic. The closing square bracket `]` is used because it represents the largest smile able to be captured using ASCII art. A closing parenthesis `)` creates a half-hearted smile, and thus is not preferred.

**Preferred**:
```
:]
```

**Not Preferred**:
```
:)
```
